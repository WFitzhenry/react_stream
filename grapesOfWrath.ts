came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed
the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and
grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country
began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and
the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The
sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along
the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a while
they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect themselves, and
they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as
the sky became pale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in the
gray country.

In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams. Gophers and ant
lions started small avalanches. And as the sharp sun struck day after day, the leaves of
the young corn became less stiff and erect; they bent in a curve at first, and then, as the
central ribs of strength grew weak, each leaf tilted downward. Then it was June, and
the sun shone more fiercely. The brown lines on the corn leaves widened and moved in
on the central ribs. The weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots. The air was
thin and the sky more pale; and every day the earth paled.

In the roads where the teams moved, where the wheels milled the ground and the
hooves of the horses beat the ground, the dirt crust broke and the dust formed. Every
moving thing lifted the dust into the air: a walking man lifted a thin layer as high as his
waist, and a wagon lifted the dust as high as the fence tops, and an automobile boiled a
cloud behind it. The dust was long in settling back again.

When June was half gone, the big clouds moved up out of Texas and the Gulf, high
heavy clouds, rainheads. The men in the fields looked up at the clouds and sniffed at
them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind. And the horses were nervous while the
clouds were up. The rainheads dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other
country. Behind them the sky was pale again and the sun flared. In the dust there were
drop craters where the rain had fallen, and there were clean splashes on the corn, and
that was all.`;
